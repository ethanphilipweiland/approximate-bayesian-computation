# approximate-bayesian-computation
This repository contains all files for the final project for STAT-S 610 Statistical Computing taught by Professor Julia Fukuyama at Indiana University in Fall 2022. This final project was a collaboration between 
Ethan Weiland (respository owner; PhD student in Sociology), Yanming Kuang (PhD student in Sociology), and Yi Liu (PhD student in Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences). We replicate a paper in Bioinformatics (2010)
by Tina Toni and Michael P.H. Stumpf; we implement Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to model disease spread. We successfully replicate this paper and conclude that a two-parameter model is appropriate for two outbreaks
of the same strain and a four-parameter model is appropraite for two outbreaks of different strains.

This repository was originally named: STAT-S-610-Final-Project
